              <h3> My Experience</h3>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p> I have a year placement which comprises of 4 projects. The first and current one revolves around memory and the differences between healthy young and elderly people. We are trying to figure out how certen aspectes of memory change with age and what other processes are involved in helping us not become a confuse mess. </p>

              <p>The following will enlove EEG testing, memory and attention and it will be my disertation project. Finally, if all goes as planed I should still have enough time to do a second part of the firtst project and a nother one envolving memory and music.
              </p>

              <p>As far I coverd the ethical application, did some backgorund researcha and tested both young and elderly participants.I find it quite interesting and I believe I have learnd some valuble skills such as working in Matlab, administering different questionairs, some social and team work skills. I am very excited for my next project and hope it will run smoothly. 
              </p>

              <p>My supervisor is lovely. She does offer the suport and guidence I need to be able to conduct this work consequently, I am confident with what I do and believe it will significally encrease my employability chances.

            <h3>How did I get it and why</h3>

            <br>
            <br>
          <p>I have to say that it was quite strongly emphasized in our classes that a placement would be a positive experience and would increase our employability chances. However, that is not why I wante to do it. I enjoy practical work and I enjoy variety in learning. Therefore, I thought it would be a good chalenge for me to take. I would be lying to say I did not think of the competition in the field. I aslo taken this placement  because the tought of finishing University scares me. I believe there are so many smart, talented and hard working people. Consequently, I considere that I need to bring at least something extra to the table to even stand a chance. I still do not know where to start after University ends but at least I am a bit more confident.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Getting the placement was quite stresfull. I applied through the university employability service. However, I did not get what I wished for from them therefore, at the recomandaiton of a friend, I approched one of the lecturers that I appreciated and looked up to. I was fortunate enough for her to take me on. That is how I ended up here. </p>

          <p>I do not have any magical advice for getting a placement. I considere that mine involved some luck. However, I would just say if you really want one go all over the place and Try!. It wount hurt.</p>

          <h4>How did I find a placement and why?</h4>

          <br>
          
          <p>I started to look for different placements' opportunities by myself online. It was not easy at all! Most of the places required already to have some experience in certain fields. As I was thiniking of staying in academia as my future carrer, I started to e-mail various lecturers at my university and simpy asking for any advices and so on. After e-mailing one of them milion times (literary milion times....) I was offered internal placement at the univeristy!(GOD BLESS YOU ALEX!).</p>

          <p> Soon after I signed my contract, another lecturer got back to me asking if I would like to work for her. And so I ended up with two internship in cognitive neuropsychology (full-time) and in developmental psychology (part-time)</p>
